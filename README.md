🚗 ParkUrWay — Smart Parking, Minus the Chaos

Finding parking in Indian cities is broken. Roads are crowded, parking is unorganized, prices are opaque, and drivers waste fuel, time, and patience just circling blocks.
ParkUrWay is a smart parking discovery and booking platform that helps users find verified parking locations, check availability, calculate cost upfront, and pay online — all in one flow.
This project is an early-stage prototype focused on clean UX, real-world feasibility, and scalability, not gimmicks.

🧠 Problem We’re Solving

Urban parking in India suffers from:
No central discovery system
Manual pricing & cash payments
Poor visibility of availability
Time wasted searching for spots
No trust or verification layer
Existing solutions mostly digitize large commercial parking lots, leaving a huge gap in local, neighborhood-level parking discovery.

💡 Our Solution

ParkUrWay provides:

🔍 Search-based parking discovery
Users can search from a curated list of verified locations.
🧾 Transparent pricing
Price per hour is shown upfront. Users select time slots and instantly see total cost.
💳 Online payments (Stripe integration)
No cash, no negotiation.
🌙 Modern UI with Dark Mode
Smooth transitions, accessibility-friendly design, and clean aesthetics.
🗺️ Map-based context (Open-source routing)
Users visually understand where they’re parking — not just an address.
🔐 Future-ready verification layer
Designed to support document upload (e.g., Driving License) and OCR-based validation.

🧩 Why ParkUrWay Is Different

Instead of trying to “do everything for car owners”, ParkUrWay focuses on one painful problem and solves it cleanly:
“Where can I park, how much will it cost, and can I pay without hassle?”
Simple. Honest. Useful.
